# Programming Documentation Website Project

This website is one of the certification projects for <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/'>FreeCodeCamp</a> Responsive Web Design course. 
The objective was to build a responsive website that serves as documentation for a programming language or framework, and includes a navbar, code
showcases and variable layouts for multiple window aspec ratios. For this project, I chose to document basic Python syntax, and I extracted text and 
code references from <a href='https://www.pythontutorial.net/'>Python Tutorial</a>.

I built this website from scratch using only pure HTML and CSS.
